# ra_tweaks

A Joomla system plugin for East Cheshire Ramblers site tweaks.

The first tweak highlights rendered Ramblers walk titles that contain a configurable marker such as `***`, while skipping cancelled walks.

## Behaviour

- Looks at the final rendered site HTML on any site page or article.
- Always loads a browser-side pass for programme pages that populate walks after page load.
- Avoids fragile browser regex escaping so Joomla optimization plugins can safely process the script.
- Finds rendered walk items containing the marker, defaulting to `***`.
- Moves the marker to the start of the walk text, before the date.
- Renders the marker as a small circular badge using the configured colour and white marker text.
- Skips items whose nearby rendered text contains `cancelled` or `canceled`.
- Also skips struck-through items.
- Applies the configured colour to the leading changed-walk text, including the date and title.
- Colours the programme-page changed-walk row text after the grade icon, including date, title, distance, and contact.
- Adds an **RA Tweaks** administrator menu item under **Components** that opens this plugin's settings.
- Optionally aligns programme walk grade icons beside wrapped title text.
- Optionally appends a coloured walk type label (STROLLER, SHORT WALK, MEDIUM WALK or LONG WALK) to the end of each programme walk title, based on the walk's mileage, so it no longer needs to be typed in manually. Skips walks that already contain a walk type or "evening walk" in the title, and skips cancelled walks.

## Install

Zip the contents of `plg_system_ra_tweaks` and install the zip in Joomla:

```sh
cd plg_system_ra_tweaks
zip -r ../ra_tweaks-1.2.1.zip .
```

Then in Joomla:

1. Go to **System > Install > Extensions**.
2. Upload `ra_tweaks-1.2.1.zip`.
3. Go to **System > Manage > Plugins**.
4. Enable **System - RA Tweaks**.
5. Configure the marker and colour.

## Updates

The plugin manifest registers a Joomla update server:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/East-Cheshire-Ramblers/ra_tweaks/main/updates/ra_tweaks.xml`

For each release, update `updates/ra_tweaks.xml` to the new version and make sure the `downloadurl` points to the matching GitHub release asset.

## Useful Settings

- **Changed marker**: `***`
- **Highlight colour**: any hex colour, defaulting to the East Cheshire logo orange `#F08050`
- **Walk type labelling mileage bands** (up to and including each maximum):
  - Stroller: up to 4 miles
  - Short Walk: 4.1–7.9 miles
  - Medium Walk: 8–10.9 miles
  - Long Walk: 11+ miles
  - Evening Walk is not detected automatically (walk start times aren't shown on the programme page) — keep adding it manually to the title.

The marker remains visible because the website key uses it to denote changed walk details.
